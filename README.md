***Introduction***
1) This is a very very simple movie recommendation system.
2) I have designed it in such a way that only the admin can enter the movies to the database. 
(One use case could be documenting for personal use and later recommending movies to friends/family based on the genre they like).
3) Based on the stored movies, the end user would get suggestions according to the genre and rating they choose.


***Tools and technologies used : ***
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, Python, Bootstrap CSS, Materialize CSS, jQuery, Git/Github, VS Code


***To access the website :***
1) Download the complete folder and extract it.
2) Open the terminal in the folder.
3) Run .venv\Scripts\activate to activate the virtual environment.
4) Change directory to core using the command : cd core.
5) Run python manage.py runserver/ py manage.py runserver whichever works for you. The second one works for me.
6) Follow the link and enjoy watching the films! ;>

PS: I plan to add a bigger database using machine learning in the future.
